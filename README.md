# CodeJam2020

Qualification Round

My Google CodeJam2020 Python solutions 
This is my first time with Google Code Jam 2020. I was able to fully solve question 1-3. I didn't understand question 4 
and I was unsure about my intuition for question 5 so I didn't implement it. I think it was a very fun experience! 

Round 1A 

I only got 2 testcases correct for the first question. I did not get the time to attempt the others at all! :(
