My Google CodeJam2020 Python solutions 

This is my first time with Google Code Jam 2020.  

I hope that the experience strengthens my knowledge in DSA. 

Here are some description on what each problem required. 

Qualification Round

First question and second question are trivial. Third is a classic nonweighted interval scheduling problem (greedy). Fourth is bit manipulation. Fifth is a combination of bipartite matching, recursive backtracking and hall's theorem. 

Round 1A 

Solved 2 test cases for the first question: it is, surprisingly, not v algorithmic! 

Second question: BFS on Pascal triangle

Third question: iterative, linked-list like matrix operations 


Round 1B

First question: BFS with optimization, some number theory 

Second question: have not attempted 

Third question: seems to be BFS?
