# My Google CodeJam2020 Python solutions 

This is my first time with Google Code Jam 2020.  

I hope that the experience strengthens my knowledge in DSA. 

Here are some description on what each problem required. 

# Qualification Round

First question and second question are trivial. Third is a nonweighted interval scheduling problem you see in DSA textbooks (greedy). Fourth is bit manipulation. Fifth is a combination of bipartite matching, recursive backtracking and hall's theorem. 

# Round 1A 

First question: String manipulation (?)

Second question: BFS on Pascal triangle

Third question: turning a matrix into linked lists


# Round 1B (why so much maths) 

First question: Mid test case can be solved with BFS, largest test case needs some olympiad maths intuition (I thank senpai for helping me figure out the right way) 

Second question: have not attempted 

Third question: seems to be BFS? 

# Round 1C 


First question: weirdly easy question??

Second question: not attempted 

Third question: Euclidean algorithm
