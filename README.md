# CodeJam2020

Qualification Round

My Google CodeJam2020 Python solutions 
This is my first time with Google Code Jam 2020. I was able to fully solve question 1-3. I didn't understand question 4 
and I was unsure about my intuition for question 5 so I didn't implement it. I think it was a very fun experience! 

First question and second question are trivial. Third is a classic nonweighted interval scheduling problem (greedy). Fourth is bit manipulation. Fifth is a combination of bipartite matching, recursive backtracking and hall's theorem. 

Round 1A 

Solved 2 test cases for the first question: it is, surprisingly, not v algorithmic! 

Second question: BFS on Pascal triangle

Third question: iterative, linked-list structure matrix operations 


Round 1B

First question: BFS with optimization, some modular arithmetics

Second question: have not attempted 

Third question: seems to be BFS?
