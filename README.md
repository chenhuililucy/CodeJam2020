# My Google CodeJam 2020 Python solutions 

I am a newbie. This is my first time sitting Google Code Jam. I didn't make it to the second round :/

I hope that the experience strengthens my knowledge in DSA. 

Here are some description on what (I think) each problem required . 

# Qualification Round

First question and second question are trivial.

Third is a nonweighted interval scheduling problem you see in DSA textbooks (greedy).

Fourth is bit manipulation, interactive. 

Fifth can be solved with bipartite matching, recursive backtracking and hall's theorem. 

# Round 1A 

First question: String manipulation (?)

Second question: BFS on Pascal triangle

Third question: turning a matrix into linked lists


# Round 1B (:()

First question: Mid test case can be solved with BFS, largest test case is math

Second question: Geometry question, binary search, interactive

Third question: seems to be BFS? 

# Round 1C 


First question: weirdly easy question??

Second question: not attempted 

Third question: Euclidean algorithm
